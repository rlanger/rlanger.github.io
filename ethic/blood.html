<h1>Blood</h1>

<p>We are corporeal beings. Aggregations of energy into matter, matter into cells, cells into self... A corporeal being is a marvellous thing to be. The remains of early stars assembled in that fantastic pattern, consciousness.</p>
<p>And yet there's something terribly disconcerting about being a body. To be a finite existence subject to change, injury, death.</p>
